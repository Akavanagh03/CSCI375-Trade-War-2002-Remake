This project is an updated redesign of the 2002 text-based video game TradeWars, which was a classic Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game, and precursor to the more modern Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. The redesign keeps the original's text-input interface while enhancing personalized gameplay to create a more immersive user experience. Players can explore planets and space stations, trade with other ships, upgrade their own ships, and engage in ship-to-ship combat. Navigation through space is guided by player-inputted directions, allowing for dynamic exploration. Encounters with planets, space stations, or other ships offer the user customized choices experiencing everything from establishing new trade routes to engaging in battle. The redesign keeps users challenged too since some ships are friendly while others are hostile, encouraging strategic decision-making. Each playthrough promises unique scenarios, ensuring replayability and a rich, evolving narrative. This redesign successfully bridges nostalgic gameplay with modern expectations, offering both veterans and newcomers a fresh take on a beloved classic game.
